# Community Text Adventure

> A text adventure game decided by the people.

## How to Play

You can access the game at https://cta2.davecode.me, but you cannot vote on new scenes to add. You can vote on new scenes on our Discord server at https://discord.gg/ABwjpk4.

In the game itself, anyone can suggest new scenes using the scene editor with the Fancy Text Maker. Just be sure to read the [FTM Documentation](/ftm.md) to learn how to harvest the full power of the editor.

In the #cta-2-scenes channel, there will be messages with thumbs up and thumbs down emojis. Simply click one of those, and your vote is casted. Scenes will have 24 hours to gather votes. If no votes are casted, the scene is not added. If there is the same amount of upvotes as down votes, the scene is not added. If there is more upvotes than downvotes, the scene is added. You can guess what happens where there are more downvotes than upvotes...

## History

On December 30th of 2018, we started a project named Community Text Adventure. As the name states, it is a "choose your own adventure" game, where the community (mainly our Discord members) suggested new paths and options to choose. You can still access the game at https://cta.davecode.me/. However, there was a problem this. We (the developers), were the ones that were actually adding the scenes in. This was time consuming, and by the end of Feburary 6th, we stopped all production and closed any unfinished paths.

We actually teased the Community Text Adventure 2 would be made and shipped on December 25th, and someone actually remembered and asked us when it was going to be done.

Starting the night of December 22nd, we started the development of Community Text Adventure 2, to be finished on the 25th. The main change is that a Discord bot handles all the voting, so we don't have to constantly commit new things. Multiple stories were added, so we can host multiple adventures using the same webpage.
